## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Regular Expressions
- Javascript Classes and objects
- Javascript Modules

### What I learned

I learned to create classes and objects of that class to handle errors. This way i can have structure and meaning with each
error and understand them better.

The options for form validations built in the browser and html5, and why to avoid them. (Server side validations).

How to validate with JavaScript scripts so i can make my own validations and customize them the way i like.

Most used regular expressions for validations and why it's not recommended to use regex to validate emails, leave it to the browser and then verify the email.

### Continued development

- CSS Writing
- Javascript code structures
- Responsive website practices
- CSS units and when to use them
